# Decision Trees and Hyper-parameter Tuning - Machine Learning Project
In this analysis, a decision tree was developed for the binary classification of mushrooms, with the aim of determining whether they are poisonous or edible. The decision tree was implemented entirely \textit{from scratch} using the programme 'Python', following an approach that allowed different splitting criteria to be explored in order to optimise the model. In particular, three splitting criteria were considered: entropy, Gini index and the Mean Squared Error, evaluated on the basis of accuracy and zero-one loss. After a comprehensive comparison, the tree that showed the best predictive performance was selected as the reference model. To ensure the robustness of the results, a cross-validation with K-fold was performed in order to verify the consistency of accuracy across multiple data partitions. Finally, the last part of the project was dedicated to hyper-parameter tuning, with the aim of further optimising the model, preventing the risk of underfitting and overfitting, and improving the overall generalisation capability of the classifier.
